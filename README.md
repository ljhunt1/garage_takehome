### Notes
* Most of the scaffolding (eslint setup, prettier setup, vite configs, etc.) are copied from another project I worked on recently, for expediency

### Local Setup
- Recommended: open in VSCode from the `.code-workspace` file and install the recommended plugins. This gets nice format on save, in-IDE linting, etc.
- Have node.js 22.9.0
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev` to run a local devserver, `npm run build` to build the app
